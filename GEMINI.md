I am building a budget tracker for Obsidian. 
Here is obsidian plugin docs: https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin

## Development

I want to build a budget tracker for Obsidian which is available as a community plugin with pro paid features.

We have to build it for desktop and mobile versions of Obsidian.
From docs:
```
The Node.js and Electron APIs are only available in the desktop version of Obsidian. For example, Node.js packages like fs, crypto, and os, are only available on desktop.

If your plugin uses any of these APIs, you must set isDesktopOnly to true in the manifest.json.
```

Use svelte for building plugin https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Use+Svelte+in+your+plugin

Always keep the code up to date.
